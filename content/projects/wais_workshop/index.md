  The [WAIS Workshop](https://www.waisworkshop.org) has been held annually for the past 25 years, providing a venue for transdisciplinary scientific exchange on the state and behavior of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, processes that influence its changing behavior, and projections of its future mass balance and sea-level contribution. These awards from NASA and NSF fund us to host the 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 WAIS Workshops.
