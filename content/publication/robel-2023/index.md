abstract: Observations indicate that groundwater-laden sedimentary aquifers are extensive
  beneath large portions of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. A reduction in
  the mechanical loading of aquifers is known to lead to groundwater exfiltration,
  a discharge of groundwater from the aquifer. Here, we provide a simple expression
  predicting exfiltration rates under a thinning ice sheet. Using contemporary satellite
  altimetry observations, we predict that exfiltration rates may reach tens to hundreds
  of millimeters per year under the fastest thinning parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet.
  In parts of West Antarctica, predicted rates of exfiltration would cause the total
  subglacial water discharge rate to be nearly double what is currently predicted
  from subglacial basal melting alone. Continued Antarctic Ice Sheet thinning into
  the future guarantees that the rate and potential importance of exfiltration will
  only continue to grow. Such an increase in warm, nutrient-laden subglacial water
  discharge would cause changes in ice sliding, melt of basal ice and marine biological
  communities.
