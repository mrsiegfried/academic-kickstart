abstract: Simple fault models predict earthquake nucleation near the eventual hypocenter
  (self-nucleation). However, some earthquakes have migratory foreshocks and possibly
  slow slip that travel large distances toward the eventual mainshock hypocenter (migratory
  nucleation). Scarce observations of migratory nucleation may result from real differences
  between faults or merely observational limitations. We use Global Positioning System
  and passive seismic records of the easily observed daily ice stream earthquake cycle
  of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica, to quantify the prevalence of migratory
  versus self-nucleation in a large-scale, natural stick-slip system. We find abundant
  and predominantly migratory precursory slip, whereas self-nucleation is nearly absent.
  This demonstration that migratory nucleation exists on a natural fault implies that
  more-observable migratory precursors may also occur before some earthquakes.
