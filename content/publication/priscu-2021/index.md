abstract: 'The Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access (SALSA) Project accessed
  Mercer Subglacial Lake using environmentally clean hot-water drilling to examine
  interactions among ice, water, sediment, rock, microbes and carbon reservoirs within
  the lake water column and underlying sediments. A ~0.4 m diameter borehole was melted
  through 1087 m of ice and maintained over ~10 days, allowing observation of ice
  properties and collection of water and sediment with various tools. Over this period,
  SALSA collected: 60 L of lake water and 10 L of deep borehole water; microbes >0.2
  μm in diameter from in situ filtration of ~100 L of lake water; 10 multicores 0.32–0.49
  m long; 1.0 and 1.76 m long gravity cores; three conductivity–temperature–depth
  profiles of borehole and lake water; five discrete depth current meter measurements
  in the lake and images of ice, the lake water–ice interface and lake sediments.
  Temperature and conductivity data showed the hydrodynamic character of water mixing
  between the borehole and lake after entry. Models simulating melting of the ~6 m
  thick basal accreted ice layer imply that debris fall-out through the ~15 m water
  column to the lake sediments from borehole melting had little effect on the stratigraphy
  of surficial sediment cores.'
