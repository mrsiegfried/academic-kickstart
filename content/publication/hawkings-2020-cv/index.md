abstract: Trace elements sustain biological productivity, yet the significance of
  trace element mobilization and export in subglacial runoff from ice sheets is poorly
  constrained at present. Here, we present size-fractionated (0.02, 0.22, and 0.45
  µm) concentrations of trace elements in subglacial waters from the Greenland Ice
  Sheet (GrIS) and the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS). Concentrations of immobile trace
  elements (e.g., Al, Fe, Ti) far exceed global riverine and open ocean mean values
  and highlight the importance of subglacial aluminosilicate mineral weathering and
  lack of retention of these species in sediments. Concentrations are higher from
  the AIS than the GrIS, highlighting the geochemical consequences of prolonged water
  residence times and hydrological isolation that characterize the former. The enrichment
  of trace elements (e.g., Co, Fe, Mn, and Zn) in subglacial meltwaters compared with
  seawater and typical riverine systems, together with the likely sensitivity to future
  ice sheet melting, suggests that their export in glacial runoff is likely to be
  important for biological productivity. For example, our dissolved Fe concentration
  (20,900 nM) and associated flux values (1.4 Gmol y−1) from AIS to the Fe-deplete
  Southern Ocean exceed most previous estimates by an order of magnitude. The ultimate
  fate of these micronutrients will depend on the reactivity of the dominant colloidal
  size fraction (likely controlled by nanoparticulate Al and Fe oxyhydroxide minerals)
  and estuarine processing. We contend that ice sheets create highly geochemically
  reactive particulates in subglacial environments, which play a key role in trace
  elemental cycles, with potentially important consequences for global carbon cycling.
