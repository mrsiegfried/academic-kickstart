abstract: Subglacial lake water-volume changes produce ice-elevation anomalies that
  provide clues about water flow beneath glaciers and ice sheets. Significant challenges
  remain in the quantitative interpretation of these elevation-change anomalies because
  the surface expression of subglacial lake activity depends on basal conditions,
  rate of water-volume change, and ice rheology. To address these challenges, we introduce
  an inverse method that reconstructs subglacial lake activity from altimetry data
  while accounting for the effects of viscous ice flow. We use a linearized approximation
  of a Stokes ice-flow model under the assumption that subglacial lake activity only
  induces small perturbations relative to a reference ice-flow state. We validate
  this assumption by accurately reconstructing lake activity from synthetic data that
  are produced with a fully nonlinear model. We then apply the method to estimate
  the water-volume changes of several active subglacial lakes in Antarctica by inverting
  data from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry
  mission. The results show that there can be substantial discrepancies (20% or more)
  between the inversion and traditional estimation methods due to the effects of viscous
  ice flow. The inverse method will help refine estimates of subglacial water transport
  and further constrain the role of subglacial hydrology in ice-sheet evolution.
