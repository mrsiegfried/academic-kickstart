abstract: Subglacial lakes have been mapped across Antarctica with two methods, radio-echo
  sounding (RES) and ice-surface deformation. At sites where both are coincident,
  these methods typically provide conflicting interpretations about the ice-bed interface.
  With a single exception, active subglacial lakes identified by surface deformation
  do not display the expected flat, bright, and specular bed reflection in RES data,
  characteristic of non-active lakes. This observational conundrum suggests that our
  understanding of Antarctic subglacial hydrology, especially beneath important fast-moving
  ice streams, remains incomplete. Here, we use an airborne RES campaign that surveyed
  a well-characterized group of active subglacial lakes on lower Mercer and Whillans
  ice streams, West Antarctica, to explore inconsistency between the two observational
  techniques. We test hypotheses of increased scattering and attenuation due to the
  presence of an active subglacial lake system that could suppress reflected bed-echo
  power for RES observations in these locations, finding that entrained water is most
  plausible.
