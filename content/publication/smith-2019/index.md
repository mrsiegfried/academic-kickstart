abstract: "The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and its sole scientific instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), was launched on 15 September 2018 with a primary goal of measuring changes in the surface of the Earth's land ice (glaciers and ice sheets). ATLAS is a photon-counting laser altimeter, which records the transit time of individual photons in order to reconstruct surface height along track. The ground-track pattern repeats every 91â€¯days such that changes in ice sheet surface height can be estimated through time. In this paper, we describe the set of algorithms that have been developed for ICESat-2 to retrieve ice sheet surface height from the geolocated photons for the Land Ice Along-Track Height Product (ATL06), and demonstrate their output and performance using a synthetic dataset over various land-ice surfaces and under different cloud conditions. We show that the ATL06 algorithm is expected to perform at the level required to meet the ICESat-2 science objectives for land ice."
