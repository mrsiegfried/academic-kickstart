abstract: Radar tomography of glaciers promises to improve imaging and estimates of
  subsurface ice-sheet structures and properties, including temperature distributions,
  basal materials, ice fabric, and englacial water content. However, bistatic radar
  data with long (i.e., larger than the ice thickness) walk-away surveys are required
  to constrain high-fidelity tomographic inversions. These long-offset data have proven
  difficult to collect due to the hardware complexity of existing synchronization
  techniques. Therefore, we remove the hardware complexity required for real-time
  synchronization by synchronizing in postprocessing. Our technique transforms an
  Autonomous phase-sensitive Radio Echo Sounder (ApRES) system and a software-defined
  radio receiver into a coherent bistatic radar capable of recovering basal echoes
  at long offsets. We validated our system at Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica,
  with a walk-away survey up to 1300 m (797 m thick) and at Store Glacier, Greenland,
  up to 1450 m (1028 m thick). At both field sites, we measured the basal echo at
  angles beyond the point of total internal reflection (TIR), whose previous literature
  had set as a hard physical limit. We support our experimental results with high-frequency
  structure simulation, which shows that ground-based radar systems capture evanescent
  waves and are not hindered by TIR. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate a system
  capable of executing wide-angle bistatic radar surveys for improved geometric and
  radiometric resolution of inversions for englacial and subglacial properties.
