abstract: Antarctica’s ice shelves play a critical role in modulating ice loss to
  the ocean by buttressing grounded ice upstream. With the potential to impact ice-shelf
  stability, persistent polynyas (open-water areas surrounded by sea ice that occur
  across multiple years at the same location) at the edge of many ice-shelf fronts
  are maintained by winds and/or ocean heat and are locations of strong ice–ocean–atmosphere
  interactions. However, in situ observations of polynyas are sparse due to the logistical
  constraints of collecting Antarctic field measurements. Here, we used wintertime
  (May–August) temperature and salinity observations derived from seal-borne instruments
  deployed in 2014, 2019, and 2020, in conjunction with thermal imagery from the Moderate
  Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared
  Sensor (TIRS) to investigate spatial, temporal, and thermal structural variability
  of polynyas near Pine Island Glacier (PIG). Across the three winters considered,
  there were 176 anomalously warm ( 3σ from background) seal dives near the PIG ice
  front, including 26 dives that coincided with MODIS images with minimal cloud cover
  that also showed a warm surface temperature anomaly. These warm surface temperatures
  correlated with ocean temperatures down to 150 m depth or deeper, depending on the
  year, suggesting that MODIS-derived surface thermal anomalies can be used for monitoring
  polynya presence and structure during polar night. The finer spatial resolution
  (100 m) of TIRS wintertime thermal imagery captures more detailed thermal structural
  variability within these polynyas, which may provide year-round insight into subice-shelf
  processes if this dataset is collected operationally.
