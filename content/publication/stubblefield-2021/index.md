abstract: Subglacial lakes are bodies of water that form at the base of ice sheets
  and glaciers. Ice-surface elevation above these lakes responds to water volume changes,
  providing one of few ways to monitor subglacial hydrological systems. Here, we use
  numerical models to compare surface elevation-derived estimates of subglacial-lake
  length, water-volume change, and highstand or lowstand timing with their true values.
  Because ice flow influences the surface expression of lake-volume change, the correspondence
  between these estimates and their true values depends strongly on ice thickness,
  volume-change rate, and basal drag coefficient. For many realistic combinations
  of these factors, viscous relaxation of the ice-sheet surface can render lake volume-changes
  unobservable with altimetry. Our results highlight the need for new estimation methods
  that account for the effects of ice flow, as well as improvements to current resolution
  limitations that render some events unobservable with altimetry.
