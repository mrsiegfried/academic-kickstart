abstract: Ice streams that flow into Ross Ice Shelf are underlain by water-saturated
  sediments, a dynamic hydrological system, and subglacial lakes that intermittently
  discharge water downstream across grounding zones of West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).
  A 2.06 m composite sediment profile was recently recovered from Mercer Subglacial
  Lake, a 15 m deep water cavity beneath a 1087 m thick portion of the Mercer Ice
  Stream. We examined microbial abundances, used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing
  to assess community structures, and characterized extracellular polymeric substances
  (EPS) associated with distinct lithologic units in the sediments. Bacterial and
  archaeal communities in the surficial sediments are more abundant and diverse, with
  significantly different compositions from those found deeper in the sediment column.
  The most abundant taxa are related to chemolithoautotrophs capable of oxidizing
  reduced nitrogen, sulfur, and iron compounds with oxygen, nitrate, or iron. Concentrations
  of dissolved methane and total organic carbon together with water content in the
  sediments are the strongest predictors of taxon and community composition. δ¹³C
  values for EPS (−25 to −30‰) are consistent with the primary source of carbon for
  biosynthesis originating from legacy marine organic matter. Comparison of communities
  to those in lake sediments under an adjacent ice stream (Whillans Subglacial Lake)
  and near its grounding zone provide seminal evidence for a subglacial metacommunity
  that is biogeochemically and evolutionarily linked through ice sheet dynamics and
  the transport of microbes, water, and sediments beneath WAIS.
