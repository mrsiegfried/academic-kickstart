abstract: We use Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry
  crossovers and repeat tracks collected over the North Slope of Alaska to estimate
  ground surface-height change due to the seasonal freezing and thawing of the active
  layer. We compare these measurements to a time series of surface deformation from
  Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and demonstrate agreement
  between these independent observations of surface deformation at broad spatial scales.
  We observe a relationship between ICESat-2-derived surface subsidence/uplift and
  changes in normalized accumulated degree days, which is consistent with the thermodynamically
  driven seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer. Integrating ICESat-2 crossover
  estimates of surface-height change yields an annual time series of surface-height
  change that is sensitive to changes in snow cover during spring and thawing of the
  active layer throughout spring and summer. Furthermore, this time series exhibits
  temporal correlation with independent reanalysis datasets of temperature and snow
  cover, as well as an InSAR-derived time series. ICESat-2-derived surface-height
  change estimates can be significantly affected by short length-scale topographic
  gradients and changes in snow cover and snow depth. We discuss optimal strategies
  of post-processing ICESat-2 data for permafrost applications, as well as the future
  potential of joint ICESat-2 and InSAR investigations of permafrost surface-dynamics.
