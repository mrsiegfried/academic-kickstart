 abstract = {We use Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry crossovers and repeat tracks collected over the North Slope of Alaska to estimate ground surface-height change due to the seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer. We compare these measurements to a time series of surface deformation from Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and demonstrate agreement between these independent observations of surface deformation at broad spatial scales. We observe a relationship between ICESat-2-derived surface subsidence/uplift and changes in normalized accumulated degree days, which is consistent with the thermodynamically driven seasonal freezing and thawing of the active layer. Integrating ICESat-2 crossover estimates of surface-height change yields an annual time series of surface-height change that is sensitive to changes in snow cover during spring and thawing of the active layer throughout spring and summer. Furthermore, this time series exhibits temporal correlation with independent reanalysis datasets of temperature and snow cover, as well as an InSAR-derived time series. ICESat-2-derived surface-height change estimates can be significantly affected by short length-scale topographic gradients and changes in snow cover and snow depth. We discuss optimal strategies of post-processing ICESat-2 data for permafrost applications, as well as the future potential of joint ICESat-2 and InSAR investigations of permafrost surface-dynamics.},
