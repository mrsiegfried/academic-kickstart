abstract: Over the past 50 years, the discovery and initial investigation of subglacial
  lakes in Antarctica have highlighted the paleoglaciological information that may
  be recorded in sediments at their beds. In December 2018, we accessed Mercer Subglacial
  Lake, West Antarctica, and recovered the first in situ subglacial lake-sediment
  record—120 mm of finely laminated mud. We combined geophysical observations, image
  analysis, and quantitative stratigraphy techniques to estimate long-term mean lake
  sedimentation rates (SRs) between 0.49 ± 0.12 mm a–1 and 2.3 ± 0.2 mm a–1, with
  a most likely SR of 0.68 ± 0.08 mm a–1. These estimates suggest that this lake formed
  between 53 and 260 a before core recovery (BCR), with a most likely age of 180 ±
  20 a BCR—coincident with the stagnation of the nearby Kamb Ice Stream. Our work
  demonstrates that interconnected subglacial lake systems are fundamentally linked
  to larger-scale ice dynamics and highlights that subglacial sediment archives contain
  powerful, century-scale records of ice history and provide a modern process-based
  analogue for interpreting paleo–subglacial lake facies.
