abstract: The grounding zone of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, exhibits an
  abrupt transition in basal properties from the grounded ice to the ocean cavity
  over distances of less than 0.5–1 km. Active-source seismic methods reveal the downglacier-most
  grounded portion of the ice stream is underlain by a relatively stiff substrate
  (relatively high shear wave velocities of 1100±430 m s−1) compared to the deformable
  till found elsewhere beneath the ice stream. Changes in basal reflectivity in our
  study area cannot be explained by the stage of the tide. Several kilometres upstream
  of the grounding zone, layers of subglacial water are detected, as are regions that
  appear to be water layers but are less than the thickness resolvable by our technique.
  The presence of stiff subglacial sediment and thin water layers upstream of the
  grounding zone supports previous studies that have proposed the dewatering of sediment
  within the grounding zone and the trapping of subglacial water upstream of the ocean
  cavity. The setting enables calibration of our methodology using returns from the
  floating ice shelf. This allows a comparison of different techniques used to estimate
  the sizes of the seismic sources, a constraint essential for the accurate recovery
  of subglacial properties. We find a strong correlation (coefficient of determination=0.46)
  between our calibrated method and a commonly used multiple-bounce method, but our
  results also highlight the incomplete knowledge of other factors affecting the amplitude
  of seismic sources and reflections in the cryosphere.
