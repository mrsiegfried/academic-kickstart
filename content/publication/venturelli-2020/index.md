abstract: Understanding ice sheet evolution through the geologic past can help constrain
  ice sheet models that predict future ice dynamics. Existing geological records of
  grounding line retreat in the Ross Sea, Antarctica, have been confined to ice-free
  and terrestrial archives, which reflect dynamics from periods of more extensive
  ice cover. Therefore, our perspective of grounding line retreat since the Last Glacial
  Maximum remains incomplete. Sediments beneath Ross Ice Shelf and grounded ice offer
  complementary insight into the southernmost extent of grounding line retreat, yielding
  a more complete view of ice dynamics during deglaciation. Here we thermochemically
  separate the youngest organic carbon to estimate ages from sediments extracted near
  the Whillans Ice Stream grounding line to provide direct evidence for grounding
  line retreat in that region as recent as the mid-Holocene (7.2 kyr B.P.). Our study
  demonstrates the utility of accurately dated, grounding-line-proximal sediment deposits
  for reconstructing past interactions between marine and subglacial environments.
