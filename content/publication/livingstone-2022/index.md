abstract: Subglacial lakes are repositories of ancient climate conditions, provide
  habitats for life and modulate ice flow, basal hydrology, biogeochemical fluxes
  and geomorphic activity. In this Review, we construct the first global inventory
  of subglacial lakes (773 in total), which includes 675 from Antarctica (59 newly
  identified), 64 from Greenland, 2 beneath the Devon Ice Cap, 6 beneath Iceland’s
  ice caps and 26 from valley glaciers. This inventory is used to evaluate subglacial
  lake environments, dynamics and their wider impact on ice flow and sediment transport.
  The behaviour of these lakes is conditioned by their subglacial setting and the
  hydrological, dynamic and mass balance regime of the overlying ice mass. Regions
  where climate warming causes ice surface steepening are predicted to have fewer
  and smaller lakes, but increased activity with higher discharge drainages of shorter
  duration. Coupling to surface melt and rainfall inputs will modulate fill–drain
  cycles and seasonally enhance oxic processes. Higher discharges cause large, transient
  ice flow accelerations but might result in overall net slowdown owing to the development
  of efficient subglacial drainage. Subglacial lake research requires new drilling
  technologies and the integration of geophysics, satellite monitoring and numerical
  modelling to provide insight into the wider role of subglacial lakes in the changing
  Earth system.
