abstract: Projections of Antarctica's contribution to future sea level rise are associated
  with significant uncertainty, in part because the observational record is too short
  to capture long-term processes necessary to estimate ice mass changes over societally
  relevant timescales. Records of grounding line retreat from the geologic past offer
  an opportunity to extend our observations of these processes beyond the modern record
  and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of ice-sheet change. Here, we present
  constraints on the timing and inland extent of deglacial grounding line retreat
  in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica, obtained via direct sampling of a subglacial
  lake located 150 km inland from the modern grounding line and beneath >1 km of ice.
  Isotopic measurements of water and sediment from the lake enabled us to evaluate
  how the subglacial microbial community accessed radiocarbon-bearing organic carbon
  for energy, as well as where it transferred carbon metabolically. Using radiocarbon
  as a natural tracer, we found that sedimentary organic carbon was microbially translocated
  to dissolved carbon pools in the subglacial hydrologic system during the 4.5-year
  period of water accumulation prior to our sampling. This finding indicates that
  the grounding line along the Siple Coast of West Antarctica retreated more than
  250 km inland during the mid-Holocene (6.3 Â± 1.0 ka), prior to re-advancing to its
  modern position.
