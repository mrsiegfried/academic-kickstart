abstract: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s Operation IceBridge
  (OIB) was a 13-year (2009–2021) airborne mission to survey land and sea ice across
  the Arctic, Antarctic, and Alaska. Here, we review OIB’s goals, instruments, campaigns,
  key scientific results, and implications for future investigations of the cryosphere.
  OIB’s primary goal was to use airborne laser altimetry to bridge the gap in fine-resolution
  elevation measurements of ice from space between the conclusion of NASA’s Ice, Cloud,
  and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003–2009) and its follow-on, ICESat-2 (launched
  2018). Additional scientific requirements were intended to contextualize observed
  elevation changes using a multisensor suite of radar sounders, gravimeters, magnetometers,
  and cameras. Using 15 different aircraft, OIB conducted 968 science flights, of
  which 42% were repeat surveys of land ice, 42% were surveys of previously unmapped
  terrain across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, Arctic ice caps, and Alaskan
  glaciers, and 16% were surveys of sea ice. The combination of an expansive instrument
  suite and breadth of surveys enabled numerous fundamental advances in our understanding
  of the Earth’s cryosphere. For land ice, OIB dramatically improved knowledge of
  interannual outlet-glacier variability, ice-sheet, and outlet-glacier thicknesses,
  snowfall rates on ice sheets, fjord and sub-ice-shelf bathymetry, and ice-sheet
  hydrology. Unanticipated discoveries included a reliable method for constraining
  the thickness within difficult-to-sound incised troughs beneath ice sheets, the
  extent of the firn aquifer within the Greenland Ice Sheet, the vulnerability of
  many Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers to ocean-driven melting at their grounding
  zones, and the dominance of surface-melt-driven mass loss of Alaskan glaciers. For
  sea ice, OIB significantly advanced our understanding of spatiotemporal variability
  in sea ice freeboard and its snow cover, especially through combined analysis of
  fine-resolution altimetry, visible imagery, and snow radar measurements of the overlying
  snow thickness. Such analyses led to the unanticipated discovery of an interdecadal
  decrease in snow thickness on Arctic sea ice and numerous opportunities to validate
  sea ice freeboards from satellite radar altimetry. While many of its data sets have
  yet to be fully explored, OIB’s scientific legacy has already demonstrated the value
  of sustained investment in reliable airborne platforms, airborne instrument development,
  interagency and international collaboration, and open and rapid data access to advance
  our understanding of Earth’s remote polar regions and their role in the Earth system.
