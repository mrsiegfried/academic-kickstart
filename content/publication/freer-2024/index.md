abstract: 'Antarctica has an active subglacial hydrological system, with interconnected
  subglacial lakes fed by subglacial meltwater. Subglacial hydrology can influence
  basal sliding, inject freshwater into the sub-ice-shelf cavity, and impact sediment
  transport and deposition which can affect the stability of grounding lines (GLs).
  We used satellite altimetry data from the ICESat, ICESat-2, and CryoSat-2 missions
  to document the second recorded drainage of Engelhardt Subglacial Lake (SLE), which
  began in July 2021 and discharged more than 2.3 km3 of subglacial water into the
  Ross Ice Shelf cavity. We used differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry
  from RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X alongside ICESat-2 repeat-track laser altimetry (RTLA)
  and REMA digital elevation model strips to detect 2–13 km of GL retreat since the
  previous drainage event in 2003–06. Combining these satellite observations, we evaluated
  the mechanism triggering SLE drainage, the cause of the observed GL retreat, and
  the interplay between subglacial hydrology and GL dynamics. We find that: (a) SLE
  drainage was initiated by influx from a newly identified upstream lake; (b) the
  observed GL retreat is mainly driven by the continued retreat of Engelhardt Ice
  Ridge and long-term dynamic thinning that caused a grounded ice plain to reach flotation;
  and (c) SLE drainage and GL retreat were largely independent. We also discuss the
  possible origins and influence of a 27 km grounded promontory found to protrude
  seaward from the GL. Our observations demonstrate the importance of high-resolution
  satellite data for improving the process-based understanding of dynamic and complex
  regions around the Antarctic Ice Sheet margins.'
