abstract: Enhanced transport of warm subsurface Atlantic Water (AW) into Greenland
  fjords has driven glacier mass loss, but the mechanisms transporting AW to the fjords
  remain poorly characterized. Here, we provide the first direct satellite-based observations
  of rapid (∼0.2 m/s) AW intrusion toward Sermilik Fjord abutting Helheim Glacier,
  one of Greenland's largest glaciers. The intrusions arise when coastal upwelling—through
  interactions with Sermilik's bathymetric trough on the continental shelf—triggers
  enhanced AW upwelling and inflow that can travel tens of kilometers along the trough
  within hours. A weakening or reversal of northeasterly alongshore winds stimulates
  the intrusions and is often associated with the passing of cyclones and subsequent
  sea surface lowering. Mooring data show that these intrusions produce subsurface
  ocean warming both at Sermilik Fjord mouth and within the fjord and that the warming
  signal in the fjord does not diminish during subsequent coastal downwelling events.
  Satellite imagery captures near-synchronous AW intrusions at multiple troughs rimming
  southeast Greenland suggesting that these wind-driven processes may play a substantial
  role in ocean heat transport toward the Greenland Ice Sheet.
