abstract: Antarctica's basal water system contains more than 130 active lakes, and
  its evolution remains a major uncertainty in future ice sheet dynamics. Most of
  our current understanding has come from using satellite radar and laser altimetry
  acquired since 2003. NASA's ICESat-2 laser altimetry mission, launched in September
  2018, provides a new, small-footprint altimetry data set with which to investigate
  Antarctic active subglacial lake processes. Here, we demonstrate the ability to
  continue monitoring active subglacial lakes at timescales shorter than the ICESat-2's
  repeat cycle and generate self-consistent time series of subglacial lake surface-height
  anomalies from combined ICESat, CryoSat-2, and ICESat-2 altimetry. Focusing on three
  regions with the known significant lake activity, we show that ICESat-2 laser altimetry
  can not only extend the record of subglacial lake activity but also provides better
  understanding of hydrological processes by capturing denser and more precise spatial
  detail.
