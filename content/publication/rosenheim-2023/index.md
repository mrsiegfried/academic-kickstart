abstract: During the 2018–2019 Antarctic field season, the Subglacial Antarctic Lakes
  Scientific Access project team cleanly accessed Mercer Subglacial Lake, West Antarctica,
  to sample water and sediments beneath 1087 m of overlying ice. A multicorer was
  successful in sampling the sediment–water interface, with 4 deployments retrieving
  10 cores between 0.3 and 0.4 m in length. Gravity coring was also successful, retrieving
  cores of 0.97 and 1.78 m in glacial diamict. However, sediment cores retrieved by
  the gravity cores were shorter than the core barrel penetration (as measured by
  mud streaks on the outside of the coring system), indicating that the system can
  likely be improved. This manuscript describes the design, implementation, successes,
  and lessons learned while coring sediments in a subglacial lake.
