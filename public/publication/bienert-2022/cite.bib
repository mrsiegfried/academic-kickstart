 abstract = {Radar tomography of glaciers promises to improve imaging and estimates of subsurface ice-sheet structures and properties, including temperature distributions, basal materials, ice fabric, and englacial water content. However, bistatic radar data with long (i.e., larger than the ice thickness) walk-away surveys are required to constrain high-fidelity tomographic inversions. These long-offset data have proven difficult to collect due to the hardware complexity of existing synchronization techniques. Therefore, we remove the hardware complexity required for real-time synchronization by synchronizing in postprocessing. Our technique transforms an Autonomous phase-sensitive Radio Echo Sounder (ApRES) system and a software-defined radio receiver into a coherent bistatic radar capable of recovering basal echoes at long offsets. We validated our system at Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, with a walk-away survey up to 1300 m (797 m thick) and at Store Glacier, Greenland, up to 1450 m (1028 m thick). At both field sites, we measured the basal echo at angles beyond the point of total internal reflection (TIR), whose previous literature had set as a hard physical limit. We support our experimental results with high-frequency structure simulation, which shows that ground-based radar systems capture evanescent waves and are not hindered by TIR. Our analysis and experiments demonstrate a system capable of executing wide-angle bistatic radar surveys for improved geometric and radiometric resolution of inversions for englacial and subglacial properties.},
