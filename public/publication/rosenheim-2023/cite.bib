 abstract = {During the 2018–2019 Antarctic field season, the Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access project team cleanly accessed Mercer Subglacial Lake, West Antarctica, to sample water and sediments beneath 1087 m of overlying ice. A multicorer was successful in sampling the sediment–water interface, with 4 deployments retrieving 10 cores between 0.3 and 0.4 m in length. Gravity coring was also successful, retrieving cores of 0.97 and 1.78 m in glacial diamict. However, sediment cores retrieved by the gravity cores were shorter than the core barrel penetration (as measured by mud streaks on the outside of the coring system), indicating that the system can likely be improved. This manuscript describes the design, implementation, successes, and lessons learned while coring sediments in a subglacial lake.},
