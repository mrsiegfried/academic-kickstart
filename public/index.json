Subglacial hydrology can influence basal sliding, inject freshwater into the sub-ice-shelf cavity, and impact sediment transport and deposition which can affect the stability of grounding lines (GLs). We used satellite altimetry data from the ICESat, ICESat-2, and CryoSat-2 missions to document the second recorded drainage of Engelhardt Subglacial Lake (SLE), which began in July 2021 and discharged more than 2.3 km3 of subglacial water into the Ross Ice Shelf cavity. We used differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry from RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X alongside ICESat-2 repeat-track laser altimetry (RTLA) and REMA digital elevation model strips to detect 2–13 km of GL retreat since the previous drainage event in 2003–06. Combining these satellite observations, we evaluated the mechanism triggering SLE drainage, the cause of the observed GL retreat, and the interplay between subglacial hydrology and GL dynamics. We find that: (a) SLE drainage was initiated by influx from a newly identified upstream lake; (b) the observed GL retreat is mainly driven by the continued retreat of Engelhardt Ice Ridge and long-term dynamic thinning that caused a grounded ice plain to reach flotation; and (c) SLE drainage and GL retreat were largely independent. We also discuss the possible origins and influence of a 27 km grounded promontory found to protrude seaward from the GL. Our observations demonstrate the importance of high-resolution satellite data for improving the process-based understanding of dynamic and complex regions around the Antarctic Ice Sheet margins.","tags":[],"title":"Coincident Lake Drainage and Grounding Line Retreat at Engelhardt Subglacial Lake, West Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin H.

This observational conundrum suggests that our understanding of Antarctic subglacial hydrology, especially beneath important fast-moving ice streams, remains incomplete. Here, we use an airborne RES campaign that surveyed a well-characterized group of active subglacial lakes on lower Mercer and Whillans ice streams, West Antarctica, to explore inconsistency between the two observational techniques.

Here, we provide the first direct satellite-based observations of rapid (∼0.2 m/s) AW intrusion toward Sermilik Fjord abutting Helheim Glacier, one of Greenland's largest glaciers. The intrusions arise when coastal upwelling—through interactions with Sermilik's bathymetric trough on the continental shelf—triggers enhanced AW upwelling and inflow that can travel tens of kilometers along the trough within hours. A weakening or reversal of northeasterly alongshore winds stimulates the intrusions and is often associated with the passing of cyclones and subsequent sea surface lowering. Mooring data show that these intrusions produce subsurface ocean warming both at Sermilik Fjord mouth and within the fjord and that the warming signal in the fjord does not diminish during subsequent coastal downwelling events. Satellite imagery captures near-synchronous AW intrusions at multiple troughs rimming southeast Greenland suggesting that these wind-driven processes may play a substantial role in ocean heat transport toward the Greenland Ice Sheet.","tags":[],"title":"Alongshore Winds Force Warm Atlantic Water Toward Helheim Glacier in Southeast Greenland","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christina Davis","Ryan A.

Records of grounding line retreat from the geologic past offer an opportunity to extend our observations of these processes beyond the modern record and to gain a more comprehensive understanding of ice-sheet change. Here, we present constraints on the timing and inland extent of deglacial grounding line retreat in the southern Ross Sea, Antarctica, obtained via direct sampling of a subglacial lake located 150 km inland from the modern grounding line and beneath \u003e1 km of ice. Isotopic measurements of water and sediment from the lake enabled us to evaluate how the subglacial microbial community accessed radiocarbon-bearing organic carbon for energy, as well as where it transferred carbon metabolically. Using radiocarbon as a natural tracer, we found that sedimentary organic carbon was microbially translocated to dissolved carbon pools in the subglacial hydrologic system during the 4.5-year period of water accumulation prior to our sampling. This finding indicates that the grounding line along the Siple Coast of West Antarctica retreated more than 250 km inland during the mid-Holocene (6.3 ± 1.0 ka), prior to re-advancing to its modern position.","tags":[],"title":"Constraints on the Timing and Extent of Deglacial Grounding Line Retreat in West Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Robel","Shi Sim","Colin R.

A reduction in the mechanical loading of aquifers is known to lead to groundwater exfiltration, a discharge of groundwater from the aquifer.

Using contemporary satellite altimetry observations, we predict that exfiltration rates may reach tens to hundreds of millimeters per year under the fastest thinning parts of the Antarctic Ice Sheet. In parts of West Antarctica, predicted rates of exfiltration would cause the total subglacial water discharge rate to be nearly double what is currently predicted from subglacial basal melting alone. Continued Antarctic Ice Sheet thinning into the future guarantees that the rate and potential importance of exfiltration will only continue to grow. Such an increase in warm, nutrient-laden subglacial water discharge would cause changes in ice sliding, melt of basal ice and marine biological communities.","tags":[],"title":"Contemporary ice sheet thinning drives subglacial groundwater exfiltration with potential feedbacks on glacier flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Savidge","Tasha Snow","Matthew R.

Significant challenges remain in the quantitative interpretation of these elevation-change anomalies because the surface expression of subglacial lake activity depends on basal conditions, rate of water-volume change, and ice rheology. To address these challenges, we introduce an inverse method that reconstructs subglacial lake activity from altimetry data while accounting for the effects of viscous ice flow. We use a linearized approximation of a Stokes ice-flow model under the assumption that subglacial lake activity only induces small perturbations relative to a reference ice-flow state. We validate this assumption by accurately reconstructing lake activity from synthetic data that are produced with a fully nonlinear model. We then apply the method to estimate the water-volume changes of several active subglacial lakes in Antarctica by inverting data from NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2) laser altimetry mission. The results show that there can be substantial discrepancies (20% or more) between the inversion and traditional estimation methods due to the effects of viscous ice flow.

With the potential to impact ice-shelf stability, persistent polynyas (open-water areas surrounded by sea ice that occur across multiple years at the same location) at the edge of many ice-shelf fronts are maintained by winds and/or ocean heat and are locations of strong ice–ocean–atmosphere interactions. However, in situ observations of polynyas are sparse due to the logistical constraints of collecting Antarctic field measurements. Here, we used wintertime (May–August) temperature and salinity observations derived from seal-borne instruments deployed in 2014, 2019, and 2020, in conjunction with thermal imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) to investigate spatial, temporal, and thermal structural variability of polynyas near Pine Island Glacier (PIG). Across the three winters considered, there were 176 anomalously warm ( 3σ from background) seal dives near the PIG ice front, including 26 dives that coincided with MODIS images with minimal cloud cover that also showed a warm surface temperature anomaly. These warm surface temperatures correlated with ocean temperatures down to 150 m depth or deeper, depending on the year, suggesting that MODIS-derived surface thermal anomalies can be used for monitoring polynya presence and structure during polar night. The finer spatial resolution (100 m) of TIRS wintertime thermal imagery captures more detailed thermal structural variability within these polynyas, which may provide year-round insight into subice-shelf processes if this dataset is collected operationally.","tags":[],"title":"Wintertime Polynya Structure and Variability From Thermal Remote Sensing and Seal-Borne Observations at Pine Island Glacier, West Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Program: NASA Transform to Open Science and NASA ICESat-2 Project Science Office\nStart Date: 1 October 2022 End Date: 30 September 2024 Collaborating Institutions: University of Berkeley, 2i2c, University of Washington, University of New Hampshire\nScience is not composed of isolated groups of practitioners, but is rather an interconnected network of communities of practice, with members that fluidly move between them.

The team will re-process these datasets from five different NSF-funded projects using modern geophysical methods to build long time-series of observations that provide insight into ice-sheet processes and test hypotheses about how stagnation occurs. In parallel, the team will leverage existing experiential field data to develop unique immersive learning modules to provide an accessible mechanism for the next generation of STEM students to experience Antarctic field work. Finally, this CAREER award will support a new pathway for a diverse cohort of researchers in the glaciology community by establishing and hosting annual regional Colorado Glaciology meetings that will connect community college educators and local glaciology researchers to exchange ideas, develop collaborations, and advertise opportunities.\nOver a quarter century of previous work has proposed that Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, may stagnate by the mid-21st century, yet the processes that drive stagnation are still largely considered only in coarse, idealized terms. This project will leverage 13 years of continuous Global Positioning System data and 29 years of seismic data to interrogate ice-stream deceleration and stagnation processes. The multi-decadal datasets will indicate the evolution of stick-slip motion of the ice stream, long-term and spatially varying ice-thickening trends, and subglacial lake activity. These data will be used to explore how coupled ice-stream/subglacial-hydrology dynamics may lead to ultimate stagnation. In addition to the scientific investigations, the team will ensure the long-term archiving of unprocessed legacy field data to support the ability of future generations to apply novel techniques to past datasets. This project will include research experiences for students from the Colorado community college system and will develop three educational modules using low-cost immersive technologies to inspire and promote ice-sheet science to students from 6th grade to graduate school as well as the public.\n","date":1659312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662739956,"objectID":"d13ccd686e60f6f6c73cd3cdd26afe9c","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/career_whillans/","publishdate":"2022-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/career_whillans/","section":"projects","summary":"Funded by NSF CAREER Program (8/1/2022 to 7/31/2027)","tags":null,"title":"Teaching old data new tricks: Leveraging legacy field data to investigate ice-stream shut down and inspire a new generation of cryospheric scientists","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Program: NASA Decadal Survey Incubation Program Science\nStart Date: 15 June 2022 End Date: 14 June 2025 Collaborating Institutions: Washington University, St. Louis\nAccurate quantification of the primary observables identified by the Surface Topography and Vegetation (STV) working group bare surface land topography, ice topography, vegetation structure, shallow water bathymetry, and snow depth requires geodetic measurements with sub-meter vertical resolution and sub-weekly temporal repeat-sampling. A multi-sensor fusion approach combining lidar, radar, and stereophotogrammetry from both orbital and suborbital platforms will likely be necessary to achieve these resolution requirements. However, a thorough investigation of the biases and uncertainties inherent to each of these geodetic measurements, as well as how these biases and uncertainties might compound in a multi-sensor fusion approach, is needed before any such multi-sensor framework can be developed and optimized.\nIn this project led by former Mines Glaciology Laboratory postdoctoral scholar Dr. Roger Michaelides, we investigate the sources of measurement bias and uncertainty in orbital laser altimetry, radar altimetry, and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements over ice sheet surfaces and periglacial land surfaces. These two surface types are subject to the time- and space-varying surface dielectric properties of snow, ice, and surface water, and subjected to seasonal and interannual geomorphic processes that can reshape surface topography (such as sub- or supra-glacial lake drainage at ice sheet boundaries and permafrost thaw and thermokarst initiation in periglacial regions), all of which complicate the error inherent in and interpretation of surface height measurements. We have three cross-cutting objectives:\nCharacterize and reduce sources of uncertainty and biases in laser altimetry, radar altimetry, and InSAR measurements over ice sheet surfaces and periglacial land surfaces. Quantify the effect of these uncertainties on vertical and rate of change accuracies for both cryospheric and solid-earth/hydrologic targets.

Nearly half of the glacier ice that reaches the ocean to form floating ice shelves is lost to basal melting by the ocean. This melting varies substantially in time and space as a result of complex climate, ocean, and ice interactions, making projections of future ice loss difficult. In particular, enhanced localized basal melt rates can incise ice-shelf basal channels that may structurally weaken ice shelves. Many of these channels convey water sourced from the upstream locations where the channels form to the edge of the ice shelf. This outflow often includes residually warm ocean water with enough heat to maintain local sea icefree ocean conditions seasonally or year-round for small areas near the ice front, known as persistent polynyas. The water in these polynyas represents a mixture between the ocean water mass that initiated basal melt and the melt content entrained as the water exits the ice shelf cavity. Variability in these features over time, as a result of climate and oceanographic changes, provides insight into ice-shelf evolution (e.g., strain and melt rates) and the processes that can weaken ice shelves. However, mapping of basal channels and their impact on ice-shelf evolution are limited. Further, direct in situ outflow measurements are sparse and little work has explored the use of remote sensing for this task.\nIn this project led by postdoctoral scholar Dr. Tasha Snow, we will use optical and thermal infrared imagery from the Landsat 7 through 9, Aqua and Terra, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3A/B instrumentation in a multi-sensor and multi-modal data fusion investigation that will assess the characteristics variability of the persistent polynya ice-ocean features in Antarctica.

The proposed work is organized around three specific goals:\nAutomate persistent polynya detection and characterization for community use; Optimize Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel-3 SST retrievals to build year-round upper ocean temperature records for multiple Antarctic basal channel outflows; and Assess ice shelf and water outflow co-evolution using a data fusion framework for deriving ice shelf and ocean parameters.

This inventory is used to evaluate subglacial lake environments, dynamics and their wider impact on ice flow and sediment transport. The behaviour of these lakes is conditioned by their subglacial setting and the hydrological, dynamic and mass balance regime of the overlying ice mass. Regions where climate warming causes ice surface steepening are predicted to have fewer and smaller lakes, but increased activity with higher discharge drainages of shorter duration. Coupling to surface melt and rainfall inputs will modulate fill–drain cycles and seasonally enhance oxic processes. Higher discharges cause large, transient ice flow accelerations but might result in overall net slowdown owing to the development of efficient subglacial drainage.

However, bistatic radar data with long (i.e., larger than the ice thickness) walk-away surveys are required to constrain high-fidelity tomographic inversions. These long-offset data have proven difficult to collect due to the hardware complexity of existing synchronization techniques. Therefore, we remove the hardware complexity required for real-time synchronization by synchronizing in postprocessing. Our technique transforms an Autonomous phase-sensitive Radio Echo Sounder (ApRES) system and a software-defined radio receiver into a coherent bistatic radar capable of recovering basal echoes at long offsets. We validated our system at Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, with a walk-away survey up to 1300 m (797 m thick) and at Store Glacier, Greenland, up to 1450 m (1028 m thick). At both field sites, we measured the basal echo at angles beyond the point of total internal reflection (TIR), whose previous literature had set as a hard physical limit. We support our experimental results with high-frequency structure simulation, which shows that ground-based radar systems capture evanescent waves and are not hindered by TIR.

Processes that affect the long-term stability of ice shelves can therefore influence the future contribution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet to global sea-level rise. The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf on Earth, and it buttresses massive areas of West and East Antarctica. Previous studies of modern ice velocity indicated that the Ross Ice Shelf’s mass loss is roughly balanced by its mass gain. However, more recent work that extends further back in time reveals the ice shelf is likely not in steady state, with possible long-term thinning since the late 1990s. Consequently, to accurately interpret modern-day ice-shelf changes, long-term observations are critical to evaluate how these recent variations fit into the historical context of ice-shelf variability. This project will examine more than four decades of historical and modern airborne radar sounding observations of the Ross Ice Shelf (spanning 1971 to 2017) to investigate ice-shelf changes on decadal timescales. The team will process, calibrate, and analyze radar data collected during 1971-79 field campaigns and compare them against modern observations collected between 2011-17. They will estimate basal melt rates by examining changes in ice-shelf thickness, and will determine other important metrics for melt, including ice-shelf roughness, englacial temperature, and marine-ice formation. The project will support the education of a Ph.D. student at each of the three participating institutions. In addition, the project will support the training of undergraduate and high-school researchers in radioglaciology and Antarctic sciences.\nThe project will test the hypothesis that, over decadal timescales, the basal melt rates beneath the Ross Ice Shelf have been low, particularly under shallow ice drafts, leading to overall thickening and increased buttressing potential. The team aims to provide a direct estimate of basal melt rates based on changes in ice-shelf thickness that occurred between 1971 and 2017. This project will extend similar work completed at Thwaites Glacier and improve the calibration methods on the vertical scaling for fast-time and depth conversion. The work will also leverage the dense modern surveys to improve the geolocation of radar film collected on earlier field campaigns to produce a more precise comparison of local shelf thickness with the modern data. In addition, the team will conduct englacial attenuation analysis to calculate englacial temperature to infer the trends in local basal melting. They will also examine the radiometric and scatterometric character of bed echoes at the ice-ocean boundary to characterize changes in ice-shelf basal roughness, marine-ice formation related to local basal freezing, and structural damage from fracture processes.\n","date":1628985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661973327,"objectID":"eddd89aafcd242505acc5cb35f66360a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/spri_rosetta/","publishdate":"2021-08-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/spri_rosetta/","section":"projects","summary":"Funded by NASA GNSS Research (8/15/2021 to 8/14/2024)","tags":null,"title":"Investigating four decades of Ross Ice Shelf subsurface change with historical and modern radar sounding data","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Program: NASA Studies with ICESat-2\nStart Date: 1 May 2021 End Date: 30 April 2024 Results from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat), as well as aereogeophysical and ground-based surveys, revealed that the fast flowing portions of the Antarctic ice sheet are underlain by complex, dynamic hydrological systems.

Ice-surface elevation above these lakes responds to water volume changes, providing one of few ways to monitor subglacial hydrological systems. Here, we use numerical models to compare surface elevation-derived estimates of subglacial-lake length, water-volume change, and highstand or lowstand timing with their true values. Because ice flow influences the surface expression of lake-volume change, the correspondence between these estimates and their true values depends strongly on ice thickness, volume-change rate, and basal drag coefficient. For many realistic combinations of these factors, viscous relaxation of the ice-sheet surface can render lake volume-changes unobservable with altimetry.

Here, we review OIB’s goals, instruments, campaigns, key scientific results, and implications for future investigations of the cryosphere. OIB’s primary goal was to use airborne laser altimetry to bridge the gap in fine-resolution elevation measurements of ice from space between the conclusion of NASA’s Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat; 2003–2009) and its follow-on, ICESat-2 (launched 2018). Additional scientific requirements were intended to contextualize observed elevation changes using a multisensor suite of radar sounders, gravimeters, magnetometers, and cameras. Using 15 different aircraft, OIB conducted 968 science flights, of which 42% were repeat surveys of land ice, 42% were surveys of previously unmapped terrain across the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, Arctic ice caps, and Alaskan glaciers, and 16% were surveys of sea ice. The combination of an expansive instrument suite and breadth of surveys enabled numerous fundamental advances in our understanding of the Earth’s cryosphere. For land ice, OIB dramatically improved knowledge of interannual outlet-glacier variability, ice-sheet, and outlet-glacier thicknesses, snowfall rates on ice sheets, fjord and sub-ice-shelf bathymetry, and ice-sheet hydrology. Unanticipated discoveries included a reliable method for constraining the thickness within difficult-to-sound incised troughs beneath ice sheets, the extent of the firn aquifer within the Greenland Ice Sheet, the vulnerability of many Greenland and Antarctic outlet glaciers to ocean-driven melting at their grounding zones, and the dominance of surface-melt-driven mass loss of Alaskan glaciers. For sea ice, OIB significantly advanced our understanding of spatiotemporal variability in sea ice freeboard and its snow cover, especially through combined analysis of fine-resolution altimetry, visible imagery, and snow radar measurements of the overlying snow thickness. Such analyses led to the unanticipated discovery of an interdecadal decrease in snow thickness on Arctic sea ice and numerous opportunities to validate sea ice freeboards from satellite radar altimetry. While many of its data sets have yet to be fully explored, OIB’s scientific legacy has already demonstrated the value of sustained investment in reliable airborne platforms, airborne instrument development, interagency and international collaboration, and open and rapid data access to advance our understanding of Earth’s remote polar regions and their role in the Earth system.","tags":[],"title":"The scientific legacy of NASA's Operation IceBridge","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Program: NASA GNSS Research\nStart Date: 1 September 2020 End Date: 31 August 2023 Collaborating Institutions: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nProjections of ice sheet mass balance and consequent sea-level rise are complicated by large uncertainties in modeling surface mass balance processes, such as snow accumulation, snow redistribution, melt, and firn compaction. In situ observations for constraining model physics and validating coupled atmosphere-ice sheet models are sparse, especially in Antarctica where surface mass balance amounts to approximately 2600 Gt of mass input per year. With more than 7 mm/yr of sea-level equivalent accumulating as snow across Antarctica, surface mass balance variability has the potential to substantially impact the rate of sea-level rise, currently estimated to be ~3 mm/yr. We propose to use an existing array of 118 long-term global navigation satellite system (GNSS) instruments from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and Ross Ice Shelf to observe net snow accumulation and firn compaction across highly variable surface mass balance regimes.\nClassical GNSS processing for glaciological applications uses direct-signal positioning techniques to resolve three dimensional ice-sheet motion. Instead, we will use the reflected GNSS signal as a signal of opportunity to generate time series of the height of each GNSS antenna above the snow surface using interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR). The GNSS stations we will use were deployed for variable time periods, ranging from two weeks to over ten years, providing both short- and long-term insight into snow accumulation, melt, and firn compaction. Our project will consist of four interrelated objectives: (1) Optimization of GNSS-IR processing for higher-resolution surface evolution both in time and in space for understanding the scientific questions this method can answer; (2) Use GNSS-IR time series to validate radar-sounding- and satellite altimetry-derived snow accumulation and firn compaction rates across variable surface mass balance regimes; (3) Improve the representation of surface processes in firn densification models and optimize model calibration using GNSS-IR results; and (4) Compare long-term trends between GNSS-IR observations and firn densification models to quantify and partition uncertainty to its sources.\nOur work will integrate GNSS-IR observations with ground-based terrestrial laser scanning, NASA’s Operation IceBridge radar sounding surveying, European Space Agency’s radar altimetry missions (ERS-1/-2, Envisat, CryoSat-2), and NASA’s ICESat-2 laser altimetry mission. We will interpret these observations in the context of state-ofthe-art climate models developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (MERRA-2, NASA-GSFC firn model) in order to validate and improve the capabilities of these models. Our effort to observe surface mass balance processes with GNSS-IR will be particularly important for ground validation of ICESat-2 altimetry, for reducing uncertainty in the conversion of ICESat-2-observed ice-volume change to ice-mass change, and for pushing forward our ability to combine radar and laser satellite altimetry results. Finally, the proposed work will help drive the development of surface-process models in Antarctica that effectively capture spatial scales driven by topographic variability and time scales of single weather events, one of the goals deemed “Most Important” by the 2017 NASA Decadal Survey (H-1c), as well as contribute many other climate variability questions (e.g., C-1a, C-1c, C-8b) laid out by this report.\n","date":1598918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1662150691,"objectID":"ea2d20211406ab7967d6e487324e0fcb","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/gnss_snowfall/","publishdate":"2020-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/gnss_snowfall/","section":"projects","summary":"Funded by NASA GNSS Research (9/1/2020 to 8/31/2023)","tags":null,"title":"Constraining West Antarctic snow accumulation and firn densification processes with GNSS reflectometry","type":"projects"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Program: NASA Interdisciplinary Research in Earth Science\nStart Date: 1 September, 2020 End Date: 31 August 2023\nCollaborating Institutions: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (lead), University of Oregon, University of Washington, University of Colorado Boulder\nThe life cycle of snow is one of the most critical unknowns of the polar climate system.

To observe tidal dynamics in the grounding zone, we moored an ocean pressure sensor to Ross Ice Shelf, recording data for 54 days. In this region the ice shelf is brought out of hydrostatic equilibrium by the flexural rigidity of ice, yet we found that tidal pressure variations at a constant geopotential surface were similar within and outside of the grounding zone. This implies that the grounding zone ocean cavity was overpressurized at high tide and underpressurized at low tide by up to 10 kPa with respect to glaciostatic pressure at the ice shelf base. Phase lags between ocean pressure and vertical ice shelf motion were tens of minutes for diurnal and semidiurnal tides, an effect that has not been incorporated into ocean models of tidal currents below ice shelves. These tidal pressure variations may affect the production and export of meltwater in the subglacial environment and may increase basal crevasse heights in the grounding zone by several meters, according to linear elastic fracture mechanics. We find anomalously high tidal energy loss at the K1 constituent in the grounding zone and hypothesize that this could be explained by seawater injection into the subglacial environment at high tide or internal tide generation through interactions with topography.

Subglacial lake locations are related to factors including heat flux, ice surface slope, ice thickness, and bed topography, though these relationships are not fully quantified. Bed topography is particularly important for determining where water flows and accumulates, but digital elevation models of the ice sheet bed rely on interpolation and are unrealistically smooth, biasing estimates of subglacial lake location and surface area. To address this issue, we use geostatistical methods to simulate realistically rough bed topography. We use our simulated topography to predict subglacial lake distribution across the continent using a binomial logistic regression, which uses physical parameters and known lake locations to calculate the probabilities of lake occurrences. Our results suggest that topography models interpolated without appropriate geostatistics overestimate subglacial lake surface area and that total lake surface area is lower than previously predicted. We find that radar‐detected lakes are more likely to occur in the interior of East Antarctica, while altimetry‐detected (active) lakes are expected to be found in West Antarctica and near the grounding line.

Concentrations of immobile trace elements (e.g., Al, Fe, Ti) far exceed global riverine and open ocean mean values and highlight the importance of subglacial aluminosilicate mineral weathering and lack of retention of these species in sediments. Concentrations are higher from the AIS than the GrIS, highlighting the geochemical consequences of prolonged water residence times and hydrological isolation that characterize the former. The enrichment of trace elements (e.g., Co, Fe, Mn, and Zn) in subglacial meltwaters compared with seawater and typical riverine systems, together with the likely sensitivity to future ice sheet melting, suggests that their export in glacial runoff is likely to be important for biological productivity. For example, our dissolved Fe concentration (20,900 nM) and associated flux values (1.4 Gmol y−1) from AIS to the Fe-deplete Southern Ocean exceed most previous estimates by an order of magnitude. The ultimate fate of these micronutrients will depend on the reactivity of the dominant colloidal size fraction (likely controlled by nanoparticulate Al and Fe oxyhydroxide minerals) and estuarine processing.

Our study demonstrates the utility of accurately dated, grounding-line-proximal sediment deposits for reconstructing past interactions between marine and subglacial environments.","tags":[],"title":"Mid-Holocene grounding line variability in the southern Ross Embayment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dustin M.

In Antarctica, most digital radar-sounding data have been collected in the last 2 decades, limiting our ability to understand processes that govern longer-term ice-sheet behavior. Here, we demonstrate how analog radar data collected over 40 y ago in Antarctica can be combined with modern records to quantify multidecadal changes. Specifically, we digitize over 400,000 line kilometers of exploratory Antarctic radar data originally recorded on 35-mm optical film between 1971 and 1979. We leverage the increased geometric and radiometric resolution of our digitization process to show how these data can be used to identify and investigate hydrologic, geologic, and topographic features beneath and within the ice sheet. To highlight their scientific potential, we compare the digitized data with contemporary radar measurements to reveal that the remnant eastern ice shelf of Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica had thinned between 10 and 33% between 1978 and 2009. We also release the collection of scanned radargrams in their entirety in a persistent public archive along with updated geolocation data for a subset of the data that reduces the mean positioning error from 5 to 2.5 km. Together, these data represent a unique and renewed extensive, multidecadal historical baseline, critical for observing and modeling ice-sheet change on societally relevant timescales.","tags":null,"title":"Multidecadal observations of the Antarctic ice sheet from restored analog radar records","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Benjamin E Smith","Nicholas Holschuh","Alex S Gardner","Susheel Adusumili","Kelly M Brunt","Beata Csatho","Helen A Fricker","Kaitlin Harbeck","Alex Huth","Thomas Neumann","Johan Nilsson","Matthew R Siegfried"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567468800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591218588,"objectID":"7da3adf990ca66db0543760a9dd2dfab","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/smith-2019/","publishdate":"2020-06-03T19:59:59.489929Z","relpermalink":"/publication/smith-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"The Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) and its sole scientific instrument, the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), was launched on 15 September 2018 with a primary goal of measuring changes in the surface of the Earth's land ice (glaciers and ice sheets).

However, due to the difficulty in accessing the sub‐ice shelf ocean cavity, the relationship between ice shelf melting and ocean conditions is poorly understood, particularly near the grounding zone, where the ice transitions from grounded to floating. We present the first borehole oceanographic observations from the grounding zone of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica's largest ice shelf by area. Contrary to predictions that tidal currents near grounding zones mix the water column, we found that Ross Ice Shelf waters were vertically stratified. Current velocities at middepth in the ocean cavity did not change significantly over measurement periods at two different parts of the tidal cycle. The observed stratification resulted in low melt rates near this portion of the grounding zone, inferred from phase‐sensitive radar observations. These melt rates were generally \u003c10 cm/year, which is lower than average for the Ross Ice Shelf (~20 cm/year). Melt rates may be higher at portions of the grounding zone that experience higher subglacial discharge or stronger tidal mixing. Stratification in the cavity at the borehole site was prone to diffusive convection as a result of ice shelf melting. Since diffusive convection influences vertical heat and salt fluxes differently than shear‐driven turbulence, this process may affect ice shelf melting and merits further consideration in ocean models of sub‐ice shelf circulation.","tags":null,"title":"Ocean stratification and low melt rates at the Ross Ice Shelf grounding zone","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew R.

Floating ice shelves, which occupy about three quarters of the perimeter of Antarctica and the termini of four outlet glaciers in northern Greenland, rise and fall in synchrony with the ocean tide. Lateral motion of floating and grounded portions of ice sheets near their marine margins can also include a tidal component. These tide‐induced signals provide insight into the processes by which the oceans can affect ice sheet mass balance and dynamics. In this review, we summarize in situ and satellite‐based measurements of the tidal response of ice shelves and grounded ice, and spatial variability of ocean tide heights and currents around the ice sheets. We review sensitivity of tide heights and currents as ocean geometry responds to variations in sea level, ice shelf thickness, and ice sheet mass and extent. We then describe coupled ice‐ocean models and analytical glacier models that quantify the effect of ocean tides on lower‐frequency ice sheet mass loss and motion. We suggest new observations and model developments to improve the representation of tides in coupled models that are used to predict future ice sheet mass loss and the associated contribution to sea level change.

Thinning reduces an ice shelf’s ability to restrain grounded-ice discharge, yet our understanding of the climate processes that drive mass changes is limited. Here, we use ice-shelf height data from four satellite altimeter missions (1994–2017) to show a direct link between ice-shelf height variability in the Antarctic Pacific sector and changes in regional atmospheric circulation driven by the El Niño/Southern Oscillation. This link is strongest from the Dotson to Ross ice shelves and weaker elsewhere. During intense El Niño years, height increase by accumulation exceeds the height decrease by basal melting, but net ice-shelf mass declines as basal ice loss exceeds ice gain by lower-density snow. Our results demonstrate a substantial response of Amundsen Sea ice shelves to global and regional climate variability, with rates of change in height and mass on interannual timescales that can be comparable to the longer-term trend, and with mass changes from surface accumulation offsetting a significant fraction of the changes in basal melting. This implies that ice-shelf height and mass variability will increase as interannual atmospheric variability increases in a warming climate.","tags":null,"title":"Response of Pacific-sector Antarctic ice shelves to the El Niño / Southern Oscillation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Funding Program: NSF Antarctic Science\nStart Date: 1 December 2017 End Date: 30 November 2022 Collaborating Institutions: Scripps Institution of Oceanography (lead), Columbia University\nThe Antarctic ice sheet is underlain by a dynamic water system that lubricates the flow of ice streams and outlet glaciers, provides a habitat for a diverse microbial ecosystem, and delivers freshwater and nutrients to the Southern Ocean. However, imaging this subglacial environment is difficult: Antarctica is a vast continent with ice up to four kilometers (2.5 miles) thick. To detect water at the ice-bed interface and in deeper groundwater reservoirs, this project will adapt a technique called electromagnetic sounding that is well-established on land and in the ocean for imaging fluids beneath the surface. Groundwater is estimated to be a significant part of the subglacial water budget in Antarctica, yet previous observational approaches have been unable to characterize its volume and distribution. This project will thus yield critical information about how ice-rock-water-ocean systems interact and inform our understanding of ice-sheet processes, global nutrient cycles, and freshwater flux to the ocean. The project will provide cross-disciplinary training for a graduate student and postdoctoral scientist, and develop an educational outreach program through the Birch Aquarium.\nStandard geophysical surveying techniques used in glaciology to image subglacial water (radio-echo sounding and active-source seismology) are not directly sensitive to water content. In contrast, ground-based electromagnetic (EM) methods are sensitive to water content through its impact on bulk conductivity. Although EM methods are well-established for high-precision mapping of hydrology in other geological environments, their application on ice sheets is in its infancy. The proposed work will adapt both passive- and active-source EM techniques to glaciological questions to quantify the three-dimensional structure of subglacial water beneath an ice stream and in a grounding zone. The project will perform a suite of synthetic inversion studies to determine the range of applications of EM techniques in glaciology and execute a field experiment on the Whillans Ice Plain to investigate two hypotheses about the subglacial water system based on previous observational and modeling results: (1) Subglacial Lake Whillans is underlain by a deep, saline groundwater reservoir; and (2) there is an estuary-like zone of mixing between fresh subglacial water and seawater near, and possibly landward, of the grounding line.\n","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661973327,"objectID":"0d83a72b3b616b5d7b577de4f019e1f7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/projects/salsa_em/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/salsa_em/","section":"projects","summary":"Funded by NSF Antarctic Science (12/1/2017 to 11/30/2022)","tags":null,"title":"SALSA EM: Mapping Subglacial Groundwater in Antarctica","type":"projects"},{"authors":["Sasha P Carter","Helen A Fricker","Matthew R Siegfried"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1485993600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594700205,"objectID":"e0fa32dbfed54573748c22e3b1a758d7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/carter-2017/","publishdate":"2020-07-14T04:08:44.63671Z","relpermalink":"/publication/carter-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Over the past decade, satellite observations of ice surface height have revealed that active subglacial lake systems are widespread under the Antarctic Ice Sheet, including the ice streams. For some of these systems, additional observations of ice-stream motion have shown that lake activity can affect ice-stream dynamics. Despite all this new information, we still have insufficient understanding of the lake-drainage process to incorporate it into ice-sheet models. Process models for drainage of ice-dammed lakes based on conventional R-channels incised into the base of the ice through melting are unable to reproduce the timing and magnitude of drainage from Antarctic subglacial lakes estimated from satellite altimetry given the low hydraulic gradients along which such lakes drain. We have developed an alternative process model, in which channels are mechanically eroded into the underlying deformable subglacial sediment. When applied to the known active lakes of the Whillans–Mercer ice-stream system, the model successfully reproduced both the inferred magnitudes and recurrence intervals of lake-volume changes, derived from Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter data for the period 2003–2009. Water pressures in our model changed as the flood evolved: during drainage, water pressures initially increased as water flowed out of the lake primarily via a distributed system, then decreased as the channelized system grew, establishing a pressure gradient that drew water away from the distributed system. This evolution of the drainage system can result in the observed internal variability of ice flow over time. If we are correct that active subglacial lakes drain through canals in the sediment, this mechanism also implies that active lakes are typically located in regions underlain by thick subglacial sediment, which may explain why they are not readily observed using radio-echo-sounding techniques.","tags":null,"title":"Antarctic subglacial lakes drain through sediment-floored canals: Theory and model testing on real and idealized domains","type":"publication"},{"authors":["T.

To minimize the introduction of surface contaminants to SLW during its exploration, an access borehole was created using a microbiologically clean hot water drill designed to reduce the number and viability of microorganisms in the drilling water. Analysis of 16S rRNA genes (rDNA) amplified from samples of the drilling and borehole water allowed an evaluation of the efficacy of this approach and enabled a confident assessment of the SLW ecosystem inhabitants. Based on an analysis of 16S rDNA and rRNA (i.e., reverse-transcribed rRNA molecules) data, the SLW community was found to be bacterially dominated and compositionally distinct from the assemblages identified in the drill system. The abundance of bacteria (e.g., *Candidatus*  Nitrotoga, *Sideroxydans*, *Thiobacillus*, and *Albidiferax*) and archaea (*Candidatus* Nitrosoarchaeum) related to chemolithoautotrophs was consistent with the oxidation of reduced iron, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds having important roles as pathways for primary production in this permanently dark ecosystem. Further, the prevalence of Methylobacter in surficial lake sediments combined with the detection of methanogenic taxa in the deepest sediment horizons analyzed (34–36 cm) supported the hypothesis that methane cycling occurs beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Large ratios of rRNA to rDNA were observed for several operational taxonomic units abundant in the water column and sediments (e.g., *Albidiferax*, *Methylobacter*, *Candidatus* Nitrotoga, *Sideroxydans*, and *Smithella*), suggesting a potentially active role for these taxa in the SLW ecosystem. Our findings are consistent with chemosynthetic microorganisms serving as the ecological foundation in this dark subsurface environment, providing new organic matter that sustains a microbial ecosystem beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.","tags":null,"title":"Microbial Community Structure of Subglacial Lake Whillans, West Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661973327,"objectID":"b1cabbde5c01279ade2d383eb54a27e6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/project_example/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project_example/external-project/","section":"project_example","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project_example"},{"authors":["K.

If this resistance is decreased as a result of ice shelf thinning or disintegration, acceleration of grounded ice can occur, increasing rates of sea-level rise. Loss of ice shelf mass is accelerating, especially in West Antarctica, where warm seawater is reaching ocean cavities beneath ice shelves. Here we use satellite imagery, airborne ice-penetrating radar and satellite laser altimetry spanning the period from 2002 to 2014 to map extensive basal channels in the ice shelves surrounding Antarctica. The highest density of basal channels is found in West Antarctic ice shelves. Within the channels, warm water flows northwards, eroding the ice shelf base and driving channel evolution on annual to decadal timescales. Our observations show that basal channels are associated with the development of new zones of crevassing, suggesting that these channels may cause ice fracture. We conclude that basal channels can form and grow quickly as a result of warm ocean water intrusion, and that they can structurally weaken ice shelves, potentially leading to rapid ice shelf loss in some areas.","tags":null,"title":"Impacts of warm water on Antarctic ice shelf stability through basal channel formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Here we present the first geomicrobiological description of water and surficial sediments obtained from direct sampling of a subglacial Antarctic lake. Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) lies beneath approximately 800 m of ice on the lower portion of the Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) in West Antarctica and is part of an extensive and evolving subglacial drainage network. The water column of SLW contained metabolically active microorganisms and was derived primarily from glacial ice melt with solute sources from lithogenic weathering and a minor seawater component. Heterotrophic and autotrophic production data together with small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and biogeochemical data indicate that SLW is a chemosynthetically driven ecosystem inhabited by a diverse assemblage of bacteria and archaea. Our results confirm that aquatic environments beneath the Antarctic ice sheet support viable microbial ecosystems, corroborating previous reports suggesting that they contain globally relevant pools of carbon and microbes that can mobilize elements from the lithosphere and influence Southern Ocean geochemical and biological systems.","tags":null,"title":"A microbial ecosystem beneath the West Antarctic ice sheet","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We use Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) data to derive estimates of lake volume change and regional thickness changes. By combining these results with a water budget model, we show that a uniform, localized thickness increase perturbed the hydropotential, resulting in a change in course of a major flow path within the system in 2005. Water originating from upper Whillans and Kamb Ice Streams that previously supplied the southern basin became diverted toward Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW). This diversion led to a tenfold filling rate increase of SLW. Our observation suggests that water piracy may be common in the Siple Coast region, where the gentle basal relief makes the basal hydropotential particularly sensitive to small changes in ice thickness. Given the previously inferred connections between water piracy and ice-stream slowdown elsewhere in the region, the subtle and complex nature of this system presents new challenges for numerical models.","tags":null,"title":"Evidence of rapid subglacial water piracy under Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John C.
